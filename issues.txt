This file is where I store things to get done
No guarantee that I will ever finish these things

- Make a better logo than a Bootstrap SVG
- Improve playerInfo.handlebars analysis tab search
  - Also add a button where analysis will be done upon pressing it
- Add "Leaderboard Royale" to playerInfo.handlebars, general tab
- Do something with fetch error that is NOT console.log
  - Maybe a logging db?
  - Also inform the user of an error
- Convert images to webp or svg for faster load times
- When errors.length > 0, do something other than: res.send("Error")
- Player Info General tab
  - Add search so you don't have to go through the entire accordion
  - Add pie chart with player card levels
- Add dark mode (idk if I can ever do this)
- Player Compare feature
- Add [loading="lazy"] to all desired pictures
