This file is where I store things to get done
No guarantee that I will ever finish these things

- Improve playerInfo.handlebars analysis tab search
  - Also add a button where analysis will be done upon pressing it
- Finish clanInfo.handlebars (make page smaller, 160,000 lines of HTML is too much)
- Add "Leaderboard Royale" to playerInfo.handlebars, general tab
- Do something with fetch error that is NOT console.log
  - Maybe a logging db?
- Convert images to webp or svg for faster load times
- Finish clanInfo war analysis
- When errors.length > 0, do something other than: res.send("Error")
