Plan for artwork is to add a section on the website with it. This doc is simply to credit where the artwork came from

The three pictures with the cards spun in circles came from RoyaleAPI. I downloaded them using this link: https://www.dropbox.com/transfer/AAAAADiWcCltUIIv5_pIpIrvwHU8nCpOQN5tbZM6gP5VHx7H1voQw-E
