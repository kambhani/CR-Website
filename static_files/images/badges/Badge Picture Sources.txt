CC, GC, CRL, and Trophy photos were taken from RoyaleAPI. For example, the GC picture was taken from: https://cdn.royaleapi.com/static/img/ui/challenge-grand.png?t=d338f299

The picture labeled Tournament was taken from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0mdu6zwzlkncu5a/AAB6bZOepV1iB3wDnNJI168aa/Misc/tournament/KeyArt/Style_2?dl=0&preview=Style_2_Logo.psd&subfolder_nav_tracking=1

The photos with the 1, 2, 3, and 4 year badges were taken by me in-game, as was the 1000 Wins badge.

The Crying King Emote (used if a badge does not a recognized name, kind of like a 404 error), was taken from: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0mdu6zwzlkncu5a/AABRc6gIW0HXv1zXODNBrUPxa/Emotes?dl=0&preview=crying.png&subfolder_nav_tracking=1
