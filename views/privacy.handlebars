<h1 class="mx-3 mt-2">Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="mx-3 mb-5">
  I collect data to do stuff (like serving the website). Idk how to make cookies with nodejs but assume that I use those as well.
  You have GDPR rights if you live in the EU (I think). I don't know what those rights are.
  I may or may not use advertising, but if I do, consider all your data forfeit.

  For legal purposes, I am required to state that this privacy policy is a joke.
  Please do not take it seriously.
